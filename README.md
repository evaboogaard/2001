# 2001: a space odyssey

Welcome to my project about the film 2001: a space odyssey.

## Setup

Download the code, now open up your terminal in the right folder. 

Run the following code:

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

If all is well, the terminal should now tell you on which localhost the website is running. Go there, and enjoy :)

## Credits

I used copyright-free 3D models for this project.
