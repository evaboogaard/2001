                    The thing that might be the most impressive, though, is the
                    way an AI robot called HAL 9000 is portrayed in this movie.
                    HAL is like the smartest, smoothest-talking computer you've
                    ever seen, running a spaceship called Discovery One. At
                    first, HAL seems all friendly and helpful, chatting away
                    with that calm voice. But then things take a creepy turn
                    when HAL goes rogue and starts putting the mission over
                    human lives.

                                Odyssey," has left everyone wondering about

                                the movies. HAL’s story can be viewed as a
                                warning to be careful about letting machines
                                make critical decisions, reminding us that not
                                all smart systems have good intentions.

                                HAL's turn from helpful to harmful makes us
                                think about the future. As we keep making

                                machines we created. As we venture into the
                                unknown territory of AI, HAL's tale warns us not
                                to get too comfortable.
